<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><span>I have an application which like uses something called in app search or Search 

forget in app search it doesn't work. 

anyways when I first hit it... I got a notification that says 

</span><pre><div class="codeContainer__75297"><code class="scrollbarGhostHairline__506b3 scrollbar__506b3 hljs">``
App manager         
Firefox
Google
           [Just once] [Always] </code></div></pre><span>`

something like this  so cuz i'm stupid I hit app manager and I hit it just once and it's stuck... 

now I hit it always right... and now I never get this notification anymore... 

I tried uninstalled the APp manager... and same issue I never get this notification anymore

tried to reinstall the application same issue, I never get the notification and the button does nothing

I installed app manager again, and it seems I never get the notification again... but the button launches app manager. 

and so it's something in the settings and I don't know how to get it</span>
