Welcome to skippy-xd!

Skippy-xd is a lightweight, window-manager-agnostic window selector on the X server. With skippy-xd, you get live-preview on your alt-tab motions; you get the much coveted expose feature from Mac; you get a handy overview of all your virtual desktops in one glance with paging mode.

Switch is similar to Alt-Tab:

Expose is inspired from Mac:

Paging shows you your entire desktop:

If you are looking for a slick and minimalistic window selector that turns every of your little grrrrh throughout the day into a little bit of a yay, skippy-xd may be for you. If you agree with https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd/wiki/Skippy-xd-philosophy, then skippy-xd definitely is for you.

Check out the youtube videos:

skippy-xd works on anything X. See https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd/wiki/Adoption#compatible-desktop-environmentswindow-managers for details.

Installation and usage is simple:

git clone https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd.git
cd skippy-xd
make
make install

skippy-xd --switch --next
skippy-xd --expose
