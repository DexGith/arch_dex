The Permanent Fix (The Real Problem)

The real issue is how you're logging into Arch and starting your desktop. You are most likely not using a standard Display Manager (like GDM, SDDM, or LightDM) and are instead logging into a text console (a "tty") and then running startx.

Is that correct? If so, this is a classic issue with a standard solution.
The Fix if you use startx

When you run startx directly, it doesn't automatically start the necessary D-Bus session that systemd needs to manage user services. You have to tell it to.

    Open your ~/.xinitrc file for editing. This file controls what happens when you run startx.
    code Bash

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

      
nano ~/.xinitrc

    

(Or use any other editor like vim, micro, etc.)

Find the last line of the file. It will probably look something like this:
code Code
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

      
exec i3

    

or exec dwm, exec openbox-session, exec startxfce4, etc. This is the line that starts your window manager or desktop environment.

Modify that line to launch your session through dbus-launch. Change it from this:
code Code
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

      
exec your-window-manager

    

to this:
code Code
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

      
exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session your-window-manager

    

For example, if you use i3, the new line would be:
code Code

    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

          
    exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session i3

        

    Save the file and exit the editor.

    Log out completely from your graphical session back to the text console.

    Log in again and run startx.

Now, your new graphical session will be running inside a proper D-Bus session.
