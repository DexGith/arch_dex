    Quick Start

Quick Start

Once you've installed Yazi, start the program with:

yazi

Press q to quit, F1 or ~ to open the help menu.
Shell wrapper

We suggest using this y shell wrapper that provides the ability to change the current working directory when exiting Yazi.

    Bash / Zsh
    Fish
    Nushell
    Elvish
    PowerShell
    Command Prompt
    Xonsh

function y() {
	local tmp="$(mktemp -t "yazi-cwd.XXXXXX")" cwd
	yazi "$@" --cwd-file="$tmp"
	IFS= read -r -d '' cwd < "$tmp"
	[ -n "$cwd" ] && [ "$cwd" != "$PWD" ] && builtin cd -- "$cwd"
	rm -f -- "$tmp"
}

To use it, copy the function into the configuration file of your respective shell.

Then use y instead of yazi to start, and press q to quit, you'll see the CWD changed. Sometimes, you don't want to change, press Q to quit.
