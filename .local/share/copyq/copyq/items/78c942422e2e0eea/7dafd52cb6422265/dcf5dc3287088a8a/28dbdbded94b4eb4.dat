Unable to start espanso as a service as it's not been registered.
You can either register it first with `espanso service register` or
you can run it in unmanaged mode with `espanso service start --unmanaged`

NOTE: unmanaged mode means espanso does not rely on the system service manager
      to run, but as a result, you are in charge of starting/stopping espanso
      when needed.
unable to start service: not registered as a service
