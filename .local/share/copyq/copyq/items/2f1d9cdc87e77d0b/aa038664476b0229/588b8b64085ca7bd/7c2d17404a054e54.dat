that's the issue because I don't know what to search for when the files get too big... only when like I access that file a lot and work on it for longer is where I start ot remember like vagule parts of it... and that's exactly what the bookmark will solve. and in addition to going there too

this way he is correct I don't have to remember each section in my brain I can just book mark it and give it a nice comment and just book mark the header. 

also for important marks he is right. as long as you give a good comment to the bookmarked location bookmarking is good

Bookmark.nvim has a way to give them comments without putting them in the code

Like a name to the mark

but the things is
I want to comment my sections in my code
and I don't want to recomment the section
I want the plugin to take the line
and use it

and I believe you can have a tree in the bookmark so you can like have this sort of 

- # ----[section 1]----

   - # still a comment within the main big comment about the ting that......
   - could comment like actuall code here

- # END----[sectino 1]----

Never tried to do so, honestly, I just have 1 bookmark per file, but it may be able to

so that when I open my list I scroll through the book mark and boom or search the book mark and then go there first to the search location to see the nearby bookmarks for context.

Ok so this book mark is smart right it tells you each bookmarks sections belong to which file right ?
