REPEAT_RATE_DELAY=0.05 # Seconds between repeats (e.g., 50ms, for 20 repeats/sec)

# 1. Send the initial key press
xdotool keydown --clearmodifiers ctrl+Left
xdotool keyup ctrl+Left # Send one full press-release immediately

# 2. Create the flag file to indicate the key is "held"
touch "$FLAG_FILE"

# 3. Wait for the initial delay before starting auto-repeat
sleep "$INITIAL_DELAY"

# 4. Loop and send key presses as long as the flag file exists
while [ -f "$FLAG_FILE" ]; do
  xdotool keydown --clearmodifiers ctrl+Left
  xdotool keyup ctrl+Left
  sleep "$REPEAT_RATE_DELAY"
done

# 5. The flag file was removed (meaning key was released), so ensure keyup
#    This is a bit redundant since we do keyup in the loop, but as a safeguard.
#    More importantly, if the loop was interrupted, we might need a separate keyup.
#    However, the xbindkeys release trigger should handle the final keyup.
